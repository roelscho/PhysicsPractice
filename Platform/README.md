Some small projects I created to practice programming physics using the Cyclone Engine. Part of the Advanced Physics class I took during my degree.

Platform project instructions:
A plane is being held up by 4 springlike cables.
The cables are attached to 4 fixed points.
Forces can be applied using the WASD keys.
