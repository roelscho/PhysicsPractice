Some small projects I created to practice programming physics using the Cyclone Engine. Part of the Advanced Physics class I took during my degree.


### Platform
Platform project instructions: A plane is being held up by 4 springlike cables. The cables are attached to 4 fixed points. 
Forces can be applied using the WASD keys.

### Wall
The application starts in a sleep state. This state can be started or stopped by pressing 'p'.
	Controls:
	'R': Reset simulation
	'N': Reset simulation with new random generated masses
	'+': Increase mass of projectile
	'-': Decrease mass of projectile
	'w': Move projectuile up
	's': Move projectile down
	'd': Rotate projectile clockwise
	'a': Rotate projectile counter-clockwise
	'f': Fire projectile
